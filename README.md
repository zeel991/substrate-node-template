This is a DEMO script of the USeOnce Pallet . 

Build the Pallet using the command 
```
cargo build --release 
```

Once done building , start the local nod using the command 
```
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

After running the Node , open a second terminal and cd `substrate-demo`
 
 In the `substrate-demo` directory run the the command the following comand to build yarn 
 ```
 yarn build 
 ```
After Building Yarn , run command 
```
yarn demo
```

This will interact with the pallet . 

Thank You .
